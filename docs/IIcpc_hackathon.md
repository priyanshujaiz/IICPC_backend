IICPC Summer Hackathon 2026 
Welcome to the IICPC Summer Hackathon 2026. Running from May 9th to June 10th, 2026, 
this competition is designed for top-tier systems engineers, competitive programmers, and 
algorithmic thinkers. Submissions will open during the final week of the hackathon. 
While participants have complete freedom to select their tech stack and utilize AI development 
tools, we strongly emphasize the necessity of a deliberate, well-reasoned architectural thought 
process behind every technical decision. At IICPC, we champion hardcore engineering 
excellence. This is not a standard "demo-to-win" hackathon; we expect high-performance code, 
system resilience, and a deep understanding of scale and distributed systems. 
Note: You can form teams of at most 3 people / team for this hackathon.  
The Challenge 
Your objective is to architect and build a Distributed Benchmarking and Hosting Platform 
designed to evaluate contestant-submitted trading infrastructure. 
The platform must allow contestants to upload their core code—such as a simulated orderbook 
or matching engine. Your system must then securely host this submission, expose predefined 
API or WebSocket endpoints, and dynamically spawn a massive, distributed fleet of "trading 
bots." These bots will bombard the contestant's system with concurrent orders to simulate peak 
market volatility. Finally, your platform must capture granular telemetry to assess the submitted 
code on latency, throughput, and correctness, streaming the results to a live, dynamic 
leaderboard. 
Architectural Components & Requirements 
Teams must demonstrate engineering mastery by building a highly concurrent, resilient, and 
decoupled system. Your solution must encompass the following core components: 
Component Technical Specifications & Expectations 
  
Submission & 
Sandboxing Engine 
A secure pipeline where contestants upload their binaries or 
source code (e.g., C++, Rust, Go). The platform must 
containerize and deploy these submissions in strictly isolated 
environments to prevent malicious code execution and ensure 
fair resource allocation (e.g., CPU pinning, strict memory 
limits). 
Distributed Load 
Generator (Bot Fleet) 
The engine of the platform. You must build a scalable traffic 
generation service capable of spawning thousands of 
distributed bots. These bots will simulate diverse market 
participants, sending high-velocity FIX, REST, or WebSocket 
requests (Limit Orders, Market Orders, Cancels) to the 
contestant's endpoints. 
Telemetry & Validation 
Ingester 
A low-latency tracking system monitoring the interactions 
between the bots and the contestant's exchange. It must 
accurately measure: 
 
● Latency: Order acknowledgment time (p50, p90, and p99 
latencies). 
● Throughput: Maximum transactions per second (TPS) 
handled before failure. 
● Correctness: Validation of price-time priority and fill 
accuracy. 
Real-Time Leaderboard 
& Analytics 
A frontend interface that streams live metrics from the ongoing 
stress tests, ranking contestants dynamically based on a 
composite score of speed, stability, and algorithmic accuracy. 
 
Expected Deliverables 
1. Working Infrastructure Prototype: A fully functional platform demonstrating the complete 
pipeline: Code Upload → Containerized Deployment → Distributed Load Testing → 
Real-Time Scoring. 
2. Architecture Blueprint: A comprehensive system design document detailing your 
microservices, inter-service communication protocols (e.g., gRPC, Kafka/Redpanda for 
metrics), data stores (e.g., TimescaleDB, Redis), and isolation strategies. 
3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automated deployment scripts (e.g., Terraform, Kubernetes 
manifests, or Docker Swarm configurations) proving that your platform can be spun up, 
configured, and scaled horizontally in a modern cloud environment.
